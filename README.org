* üöÄ Emacs is Like an Ancient Starship From an Advanced Alien Civilization, Found Half-buried in The Amazon Jungle.

** This is your human-written launch sequence to get into space.

Overwhelmed by complex Emacs distros like Doom-Emacs or Spacemacs? You want to roll your own Emacs config bottom-up? Or you don't want to configure Emacs at all? But ... just use it? Right now? ü§Ø

*Emacs ONBOARD is a comprehensive, portable starter-kit for Emacs.*
It's not supposed to replace your ~init.el~, but loaded from there as a library (see installing instructions down below). Consider it as a "normalize.css", but for Emacs.

Emacs ONNBOARD is vanilla Emacs, but gives you a vastly better user experience, without any 3rd-party packages.

*It's all built-in -- all on board.*

‚úî One single file, ZERO dependencies

‚úî Beginner-friendly

‚úî Convenient drop-in config: just load it from your init.el

** Vastly better defaults

Some features -- without any dependencies, and without re-inventing the wheel:

- Ergonomic leader key / Localleader key menus (super easy to extend).
  That gives you infinite room for your own keybindings under the leader prefix!
  - In graphical Emacs, the leader key is "C-,"; reach the local leader via "C-, C-,".
  - For Emacs running within a terminal emulator, reach the leader via "C-z", and the local leader via "C-z C-z".
- Vertical completion for commands, files, etc. in the minibuffer.
- Tree-sitter: handle language grammars and trigger build/install declaratively.
- Toggle between your light/dark theme via =<leader> x t=; you can also run own Elisp code triggered by switching themes, e.g. for adjusting fonts and other personal styling, depending on the theme variant.
- Smooth, pixel-based scrolling (Emacs doesn't do that by default).
- Comprehensive [[https://orgmode.org][Org mode]] setup.
- MacOS ready: the <Command> key acts as <Ctrl> key, and the <Option> key acts as <Meta> key.
- Garbage Collector tuning: includes "[[The Emacs Garbage Collection Magic Hack][The Emacs Garbage Collection Magic Hack]]".
- Package manager is pre-configured with [[https://melpa.org/#/][MELPA]]: install from over 5500 Emacs packages right away.
- Makes it easy to set the fonts you like -- all options at one place.
- The Emacs file-manager Dired doesn't accumulate used buffers.
- Dired uses the system trash instead of deleting files right away.
- Clean directory listings per default in Dired, toggle via =(=.
- Hide and show hidden files (dotfiles) in Dired simply by typing =.=
- Clipboard integration just works, even on Windows.
- WSL (Windows Subsystem for Linux) copy/paste between Windows apps and Emacs.
- Copy the path of the current file to the clipboard via =M-x eon-copy-file-path=.
- Browse your kill ring (the Emacs "clipboard") via =M-y= and insert directly.
- Open files in desktop apps via =M-RET= (uses xdg-open; Linux only for now).
- Visit any file when the file name is under the cursor: =C-z C-.=.
- Kill all buffers at once via =M-x eon-kill-buffers=.
- Open Shell- and Eshell buffer via =C-z e s= and =C-z e e=
- Quickly reach the =*scratch*= buffer via =C-z s s=.
- Visit any URL in your browser via =C-z g w=, and via =C-z g W= in Emacs built-in browser.
- Emacs saves versioned backups of your files to =~/.emacs.d/backup/= before editing.
- Sending emails directly from Emacs: includes an SMTP-template for you to get started.

** TRY IT

1. Download [[https://github.com/monkeyjunglejuice/emacs.onboard/releases/latest/download/eon.el][eon.el]]

2. Open a terminal

3. Run the shell command: ~emacs -q --load ~/path/to/eon.el~

** INSTALL

*1. Clone this repository*:
#+begin_src shell
git clone https://github.com/monkeyjunglejuice/emacs.onboard.git ~/.emacs.onboard
#+end_src

*2. Put this in your Emacs init file*
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (load-file (expand-file-name "~/.emacs.onboard/eon.el"))
#+end_src

*3. (Re)start Emacs*

/You don't have a init file or don't know where it is? With a freshly installed Emacs there is no init file. But you can ask Emacs where it expects to find the init file:/

"M-x describe-variable" <RET> user-init-file

Typical results:

- on Linux / Unix / MacOS
  - =/home/USERNAME/.emacs=
  - =/home/USERNAME/.emacs.d/init.el=
- on Windows
  - =c:/Users/USERNAME/AppData/Roaming/.emacs=
  - =c:/Users/USERNAME/AppData/Roaming/.emacs.d/init.el=

** Getting comfortable

The seemingly weird keybindings are not what make Emacs. They are in fact secondary. All these keybindings are just convenience shortcuts to use /commands/, but they are not the commands themselves. The commands are the really interesting things. What that means:

*** Emacs has only 2 really important keybindings:

"M-x" ‚Äî Press <Alt>+<x> to show all commands

"C-g" ‚Äî Get out! Press <Ctrl>+<g> to cancel whatever happens (or hit 3x <ESC> in utter panic ‚Äì same effect!)

**** Examples:

- "M-x list-packages" Install 3rd-party packages (the "Emacs app store" or "Emacs marketplace" /cough-cough capitalism cough-cough/)
- "M-x check-parens" Check if all parens match (within Emacs Lisp code)
- "M-x help" to reach the ultimate help menu

** Why yet another Emacs starter-kit?

Legit question. Well, when I was setting up a VM to test some things, I wished I had a one-file-config that I can simply drop in and have a sane Emacs environment in no time.

And later then, when I was cleaning up my Emacs config, I realized that I haven't touched some parts within the last months or so. They just worked incredibly well.

So I stripped out those parts and put it all in one file, and made them my core config. Then added some grooming to make everything digestable for the public, and -- here we are.

Actually I use not only that config file, but have my Emacs config split into several modules -- an extension layer where 3rd-party packages are configured, configs for programming languages, etc ‚Ä¶

‚Ä¶ but this is the üíù piece.

*Backwards-compatibility* follows the Emacs version 28.2 in Debian Stable.
- Emacs 26 and Emacs 27 are no longer supported since 27.01.2024.

** Goals

- Portable: Should work on recent Linux/Unix, Windows and MacOS systems, while maintaining reasonable backwards-compatibility.
- Beginner-friendly: Novice Emacs users willing to touch Elisp code should be able to follow. Elisp code should be free from errors and warnings.
- Use only built-in packages and features enabled by the GNU Emacs distribution's default build options.
- Extendable by 3rd-party packages without interfering or breaking things.
- Don't be invasive: Provide an Emacs config as a library; don't try to be a replacement, rather an add-on.
- Documentation is first class; it should be clear why something is in the code.
- Modular simplicity: Code should not be intertwined, but easily modificable and separately usable.

** Non-goals

- Providing a whole new experience like Spacemacs or Doom-Emacs.
- Re-configuring keybindings (with few exceptions).
- Pre-configure everything and the cat's pillow (if you know cats ...).
- (Re)creating functionality where a 3rd-party package would be a better fit.
